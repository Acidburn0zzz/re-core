NAME
----
re-core - execute all releases through to completion



SYNOPSIS
--------
re-core [-h] --config CONFIG



DESCRIPTION
----------
This is the core component of the Inception Release Engine. The core
is essentially a finite state machine (**FSM**) hooked into a message bus
and a database.

The core oversees the execution of all release steps for any given
project. The core is separate from the actual execution of each
release step. Execution is delegated to the worker component.
