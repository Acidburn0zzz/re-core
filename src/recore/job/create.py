Reference the project name against the database to retrieve a list of
release steps to execute.

For now we're just going to pretend we did that part.

We then generate a correlation_id by inserting a new document into the
'state' collection. The correlation_id is equivalent to the
automatically generated '_id' property of this document.

In the future that ID will be passed to the workers. For now we will
just return it.
